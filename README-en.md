import { useForm, FormProvider } from "react-hook-form";

function MyForm() {
	const methods = useForm();

	const onSubmit = (data: any) => {
		console.log(data);
	};

	return (
		<FormProvider {...methods}>
			<form
				onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}
				className="space-y-4"
			>
				<InputField
					name="email"
					label="Email Address"
					type="email"
					rules={{ required: "This field is required" }}
					placeholder="Enter your email"
				/>
				<button
					type="submit"
